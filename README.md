# Cyclic Tag
## Cyclic tag implemented in various languages

Rules for submitting:

1. If your language does not already have a folder, please make one. Otherwise, add your file to the folder. Extend the associated readme with your submission title and github username.
2. Name the file something distinct and meaningful.
3. If you have multiple files for a single submission, create a subfolder with a distinct and meaningful name.
